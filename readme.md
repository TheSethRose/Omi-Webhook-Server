# Omi Webhook Server

A Python server that receives and processes webhook notifications from the [Omi](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi) app. This server handles real-time memory creation, audio streaming, and transcription events for Omi wearable devices.

## Important Note

This webhook server provides the foundation for receiving events from the Omi app (memory creation, audio streaming, transcripts), but it doesn't include default actions or behaviors for these events. It's essentially a listener that acknowledges receipt of events - what happens afterward depends on your implementation.

To make this server useful for your needs, you'll need to:

1. **Define Event Behaviors**: Add your own logic to the handlers in `audio_events.py`, `memory_events.py`, etc., to process data, store it, or trigger workflows
2. **Implement Responses**: Decide how to handle each event (e.g., save to database, trigger notifications, call other APIs)
3. **Add Error Handling**: Ensure your custom logic handles errors gracefully
4. **Test Your Implementation**: Validate that your added functionality works as expected

Think of this as the foundation - you'll need to build the actual functionality on top of it!

## Overview

This webhook server is designed to work with all Omi wearable devices and has been confirmed working with the Dev Kit 1. Omi devices are open-source AI wearables that enable automatic, high-quality transcriptions of meetings, chats, and voice memos. The server implements webhook endpoints that align with Omi's webhook system (`/app/lib/backend/http/webhooks.dart`) to handle:

1. Memory Events (from `message_event.dart`)
   - `memory_created` - New memory creation
   - `new_memory_create_failed` - Failed memory creation
   - `new_processing_memory_created` - Processing memory initiated
   - `memory_processing_started` - Memory processing started
   - `processing_memory_status_changed` - Processing status updates
   - `memory_backward_synced` - Memory sync completed

2. Audio Events
   - `audio_bytes` - Real-time PCM audio streaming from the Dev Kit 1

3. Transcript Events
   - `transcript_segment` - Real-time speech-to-text segments

4. System Events
   - `ping` - Health check endpoint

## Setup

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Generate a secret: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
PORT=32768
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO          # Controls general logging verbosity
LOG_EVENTS=false        # Set to true to see detailed event logs
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

## Logging

The server provides two levels of logging control:

1. `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls general logging verbosity
   - INFO: Show basic operation logs (default)
   - WARNING: Show only warnings and errors
   - ERROR: Show only errors
   - DEBUG: Show detailed debug information
   - CRITICAL: Show only critical errors

2. `LOG_EVENTS`: Controls event detail logging
   - false: Show basic event information (default)
   - true: Show detailed event data including request/response payloads

Example with LOG_EVENTS=false:
```
2024-03-20 14:23:06 [INFO] memory_created | uid:test-user-1 | status:200
```

Example with LOG_EVENTS=true:
```
2024-03-20 14:23:06 [INFO] memory_created | uid:test-user-1 | status:200 | data:{'type': 'memory_created', 'memory': {...}} | response:{'message': 'Success'}
```

Note: Errors and warnings are always logged with full details regardless of LOG_EVENTS setting.

## Webhook Configuration in Omi

In the Omi app settings, configure your webhook URL:

```
http://your-server:32768/webhook?key=YOUR_SECRET
```

The Omi app will automatically:

- Add the `uid` parameter to requests
- Send JSON-formatted webhook payloads
- Include `Content-Type: application/json` header

## Event Payloads

1. Memory Event (from `message.dart`):

```json
{
    "type": "memory_created",
    "memory": {
        "id": "memory_id",
        "created_at": "ISO8601_timestamp",
        "text": "memory_content",
        "structured": {
            "title": "memory_title",
            "emoji": "memory_emoji"
        }
    }
}
```

2. Audio Event:

```json
{
    "type": "audio_bytes",
    "audio": "hex_encoded_pcm_audio"
}
```

3. Transcript Event (from `transcript_segment.dart`):

```json
{
    "type": "transcript_segment",
    "segment": {
        "text": "transcribed_text",
        "start_time": 0.0,
        "end_time": 2.5,
        "confidence": 0.95
    }
}
```

## Testing

1. Run all tests:

```bash
python test.py
```

2. Test individual endpoints:

```bash
# Test ping
curl -X POST "http://localhost:32768/webhook?uid=test-user-1&key=YOUR_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"ping"}'

# Test memory creation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:32768/webhook?uid=test-user-1&key=YOUR_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "memory_created",
    "memory": {
      "id": "test-1",
      "created_at": "2024-03-19T12:00:00Z",
      "text": "Test memory"
    }
  }'
```

## Security

1. Authentication:
   - URL key parameter must match WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Each request must include valid user ID

2. Input Validation:
   - Memory format validation
   - Audio format validation
   - Transcript format validation

3. Error Handling:
   - Invalid requests return 400 status
   - Authentication failures return 401
   - Server errors return 500

## Development

1. Local Testing:

```bash
# Start server
python server.py

# In another terminal
python test.py
```

2. Testing with Omi App:
   - Install ngrok: <https://ngrok.com/download>
   - Start your webhook server: `python server.py`
   - Create tunnel to your server: `ngrok http 32768`
   - Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
   - Configure in Omi app:

     ```bash
     Webhook URL: https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook?key=YOUR_SECRET
     ```

   - Omi will automatically append the uid parameter

Note: ngrok is only needed for local development when you want to test with the actual Omi app. For production, you'll want to host the webhook server on a proper server with a static IP/domain.
